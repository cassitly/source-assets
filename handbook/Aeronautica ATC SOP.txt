1.0 Operations
1.1 Separation Minima
Minimum radar separation minima shall be three (3) nautical miles below 18,000ft MSL (FL180) and five (5) nautical miles at or above 18,000ft MSL.


Other types of separation may be used in lieu of radar separation as permitted within each region’s minimum separation standards.
1.2 Regions
Aeronautica ATC has established the following regions, categorized into separate Flight Information Regions (FIRs):

  
 











Each FIR shall use the following foundational ATC policies and procedures:


FIR
	Regions
	Real-Life ATC Foundational Procedure Source
	FAA
	Oconia, Aesir, Alavega
	Federal Aviation Administration (United States)
	ICAO
	Kyokkou, Leovetsk
	International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
	CAA
	Avalon, Enoksen
	Civil Aviation Authority/NATS (United Kingdom)
	
ATC procedures (including separation minima and phraseology) for each FIR shall be modeled and based on ATC procedures of the above mentioned foundational sources.


1.3 Units and Phraseology
Terminology and phraseology for each FIR shall be based on the following documents:


FIR
	Document
	Publisher
	FAA
	JO 7110.65 - Air Traffic Control
	Federal Aviation Administration 
	ICAO
	Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services
	International Civil Aviation Organization 
	CAA
	CAP 493: Manual of Air Traffic Services
	Civil Aviation Authority
	
Controllers shall not deviate from standard units and phraseology within each FIR to assist pilots.

The following units shall be used regardless of FIR requirements:
- Altitude: Feet (ft)
- Distance: Nautical Mile (nm)
- Speed Knot (kt)
- Vertical Speed: Feet per minute (ft/min)
1.4 ATIS Creation
For each airport staffed by an S1, S1+, S2, or S3 controller, an Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS) report shall be made. If a single airport is staffed by multiple controllers, the highest position up to S2 shall be responsible for creating the ATIS report. For airports with only S3 coverage, the Approach/Departure controller shall make an abbreviated ATIS.


EXAMPLE: If KCIA Tower and KCIA Ground are both online, KCIA Tower shall create the ATIS.


The controller creating the ATIS shall coordinate with the Approach/Departure (or C1) controller on runway assignments and the advertised type of approach to be used at the airport prior to creating the ATIS if online.


At each airport, the Tower controller shall set which runways will be in use and the S3/C1 controller shall set the advertised approach for each landing runway. If there is no S3/C1 controller online, the visual approach shall be advertised on the ATIS to all landing runways.

1.5 Handoff and Control Boundaries


Controller Handoffs shall happen within the following points unless otherwise coordinated between controllers during an event/session:

Terms:
DEL = Clearance Delivery | GND = Ground Control | TWR = Tower | DEP = Departure | APP = Approach | CTR = Center/Area Control


Handoff
	Departure
	Arrival
	DEL-GND
	Once CD receives a correct readback of the clearance, CD shall advise the aircraft to contact GND for push and start.
	N/A
	GND-TWR
	Aircraft shall switch to TWR automatically when holding short of the active runway.
	TWR shall switch the aircraft to GND when the aircraft clears the runway.
	TWR-DEP/APP
	TWR shall hand off a departing aircraft to departure once airborne and clear of all potential conflict. Handoff should occur within 5NM of the departure end of the runway.
	APP shall hand off the aircraft to TWR when the aircraft is cleared AND established on the approach or within 5NM of the runway threshold, whichever occurs first.
	DEP/APP-CTR
	No less than 2NM of DEP’s boundary or before leaving DEP’s vertical boundary*.
	No less than 2NM of the boundary or entering APP’s vertical boundary*.
	*Note - Controllers cannot give altitude assignments that will enter another controller’s airspace.


________________
1.6 Altitude Assignments


Altitude assignments shall be as follows:



	East Bearing (360-179)
	West Bearing (180-359)
	IFR Above 3,000ft
	Odd Altitudes 
Example: 5,000, 7,000, 9,000
	Even Altitudes 
Example: 4,000, 6,000, 8,000
	VFR Above 3,000ft 
	Odd Altitudes + 500ft
Example: 5,500, 7,500, 9,500
	Even Altitudes + 500ft 
Example: 4,500, 6,500, 8,500
	VFR AOB 3,000ft
	Any Altitude
	Any Altitude
	IFR AOB 3,000ft
	Any altitude above the MSA/MVA
	Any altitude above the MSA/MVA
	
Temporary incorrect altitude assignments are permitted to ensure separation of traffic as long as the aircraft is returned to a correct altitude assignment before being handed-off to the next controller.


For departing aircraft, initial altitude shall be 5,000ft unless otherwise coordinated with the appropriate departure/center/area-control controller. If no departure/center/area-controllers are online, departing aircraft shall be cleared to their requested altitude.
1.7 IFR Clearance Readback Requirement


Pilots may read back IFR clearances either in its entirety or by only responding with the correct squawk code. If a pilot responds with only the correct squawk code, the controller must not require the pilot to readback the entire clearance.

Controllers may add additional guidance or assist with full readback of a clearance for a pilot if:
- The pilot requests it.
- The request will not cause undue delay of other aircraft. 


1.8 SID/STAR Policy


A pilot may only fly a SID/STAR if the procedure is on the pilot’s submitted flight plan and has received clearance through ATC either directly or through a departure clearance.

A controller may assign an aircraft to a SID/STAR as long as the additional procedure does not add undue delay to the aircraft.

If a pilot does not wish to fly a SID or STAR, the pilot must put “NO SID”, “NO STAR” or “NO SID AND STAR” to the remark section of their flight plan. If the pilot has this in the remarks section of their flight plan, controllers cannot assign a SID/STAR to that pilot.
1.9 Realistic Frequencies/Identifiers
Realistic identifiers used by controllers (Example: “Heathrow Tower” for Anhedral) is permitted under the following conditions:
        - ATIS report includes the in-game name of the controlling airport.
        - Pilots within airspace understand what the in-game airport is.
        - The frequency of the control position remains the same per the Aero ATC published charts.
        - Pilots are permitted to still use the in-game name if requested.
        - The in-discord frequency remains under the same name as per Aeronautica airport names.
1.10 Special Flight Operations


FLIGHT INSPECTION SERVICE - “FLIGHT CHECK”

The Flight Inspection Service is a group of controllers and pilots authorized to conduct inspections of in-game landing systems, ensure accuracy of NOTAMs, testing of SIDs/STARs, and verify the integrity of published charts after game updates. Flight Check also tests proposed airways, approaches, SIDs, STARs, and other procedures for the Chart Development Team before implementation.

Flight Check aircraft shall be identified with the callsign “FLIGHT CHECK” followed by a two digit number assigned to each controller/pilot in the authorized Flight Check livery. Flight Check shall file flight plans with “FLC” plus their two digit number as their callsign (Ex: FLC22).

Flight Check aircraft may request to test equipment/procedures that differ from ongoing operations (Example: ILS test of RWY18 while RWY36 is in use). These requests shall be honored by controllers as soon as practical unless traffic conditions do not permit. Flight Check pilots shall accommodate as much as practical to prevent undue delay of normal operations.

The Flight Inspection Service is managed by the Training Manager in collaboration with the Chart Development Manager. All Flight Check pilots must be approved by the Training Manager. Unauthorized Flight Check operations shall result in moderation action determined by the Moderation Director.



MILITARY OPERATIONS

Military operations include any aircraft primarily used by any military worldwide. This must be current aircraft, and does not include warbirds, or other retired aircraft unless used in any active military. Military operations shall not be conducted during controller training sessions and evaluations.

“Hot Scrambles”  shall only be permitted during specific events authorized by the Operations Director. When “hot scrambles” are authorized during an event, controllers in the event shall be notified of the authorization in the event briefing. Non-authorized “hot scrambles” shall result in moderation action determined by the Moderation Director.

Intercepts shall only be permitted during specific events authorized by the Operations Director. Non-authorized intercepts shall result in moderation action determined by the Moderation Director.

Aerial Refueling operations shall only be conducted within the following authorized areas:

FIR
	Permitted Area(s)
	FAA
	Military Operation Areas (MOAs) Only (3,000ft  to 17,999ft MSL)
	ICAO
	NONE
	CAA
	TRA001
	

Aerial refueling operations will not be controlled by ATC within permitted areas. ATC services shall resume upon completion of aerial refueling operations and outside of the permitted area. ATC shall ensure separation of non-participating aircraft from the permitted area. Participating aircraft within the permitted area are responsible for their own separation. Pilots must notify ATC when aerial refueling operations are being conducted and of their completion. 

Non-participating aircraft shall be separated at least 3nm laterally and/or 2,000ft vertically from permitted area boundaries during ongoing aerial refueling operations.

1.11 Chart Development


FLIGHT INFORMATION REGION SPECIFIC CHARTS
* All regions within Aero ATC (FAA, CAA, ICAO) shall have their own style of chart as per real life chart examples.
* Chart Developers may create universal style charts (Jeppesen) at their own discretion, though national styled charts are preferred.


REGION RESTRICTIONS
* Until out of the probationary period chart developers may only create charts for their primary FIR. 
* Airfield charts, SIDs and STARs may not utilize incorrect style of chart per FIR, (Example, Tikaranto charts, plates, may not be created under a NAVCAN style of chart as CTIK is under the FAA FIR).
* FIR style charts may not be created for airfields outside of that specific FIR (Example Clarence must not be done in CAA style charts).


CHART REQUIREMENTS
* Airfields with completed charts (ground, approach, arrival, departure) must not have those charts redesigned unless, 
   * The chart poses a threat to aircraft (incorrectly designed chart for terrain)
   * The chart is grossly out of date (Updated airfield or terrain).
* Airfield redesign charts must be done with the approval of the Operations Director or the Chart Manager.


1.12 ATC Training & Rank Certification
ATC training and certification of ranks shall be in accordance with the Aeronautica ATC Training SOP (See 4.4 References).

________________
3.0 Moderation
3.1 Standard Guidelines
* Moderators shall not escalate any situations.
* Moderators are part of a third-party review system and shall conduct themselves as such.
* Communication from moderators regarding moderation action should be clear, concise, and professional.
* Cross-banning shall be done with partnered servers.
3.2 Warnings
Warnings should be administered for small infractions of Discord, server, and ASOP policies that do not require moderation action but should be discouraged (Example: Chat Spamming).

Warnings must include the Moderator’s name and the reason for the action. Warnings involving a timeout shall include the duration of the timeout in the warning reason. Timeout warnings must not exceed 24 hours.

Procedures for Administering a Warning:
1. Decide on moderation action if needed.
2. If moderation action is needed, document action taken and administer a warning through Dyno.
3. Check user’s moderator history for previous moderation actions that could indicate repeated behavior.
4. If repeated behavior, a strike should be considered at the Moderator’s discretion.

The following information shall be documented in the Dyno warning when issued:
- Incident Summary
- Moderation Action used (if taken)
- Whether this incident is a repeat occurrence.
3.3 Strikes        
Aeronautica ATC moderation utilizes a three strike system. Community members accumulating three strikes shall be permanently banned from the Discord server.

Strikes are administered as a serious moderation action and require the Strike Process (see below) to be utilized. 

When a Moderator administers a strike, moderation action such as long-term timeout or removal of channel access are authorized at the Moderator’s discretion. Temporary and permanent bans require approval of the Moderation Director or a Senior Moderator. If either are not available within a reasonable amount of time, the Community Ambassador may approve the request.

Procedures for Administering a Strike:
1. Open a moderation ticket, assign the user, and mute the user.
2. State the reason for the strike, the strike number, and administer the strike via warning through Dyno
3. Close the ticket and administer appropriate moderation action listed in the strike process.

The following information must be listed in the moderation ticket for a strike before the ticket is closed:
- Strike Number
- Incident Summary
- Ticket Number
- Moderator Name
- Date of Moderation Action

All strikes shall also be counted as a warning, however warnings do not count as a strike unless otherwise stated by the Moderation Director.

STRIKE PROCESS
Strike 1: Warning and a 24 hour mute.
Strike 2: Warning and a temporary ban not to exceed 14 days.
Strike 3: Permanent Ban

Permanent Bans may be appealed depending on severity. Ban appeals shall only be read by a Senior Moderator or the Moderation Director. The Community Ambassador may read the appeal if the other parties are not available.
